Identify the current date from the examples and calculate the date one week (7 days) before today. Use the same logic for all input-output pairs to ensure consistency in the results.  
Calculate the date in the past by subtracting a certain number of years, days, weeks, or days from a given date.

Ð¡alculate the date one week (7 days) ago, which aligns with the correct answers provided.
Provide the date format, the action (calculate one week from today or a specific number of days ago), and the output format of the options. Use this information to understand how the outputs were generated.
Please provide a date in the MM/DD/YYYY format. It was [specific date] a certain number of days ago. What is the date [number of days later/earlier] in MM/DD/YYYY?
Calculate the date...<br>the first day of 2007. What is the date one week ago in MM/DD/YYYY?<br> add 24 hours (1 day)<br> subtract 7 days
I told you about calculating the date one year ago from today based on the current date provided. For example, if today is Christmas Eve of 1937, one year ago would be June 2016. Similarly, when Jane thought today was 6/18/2019 but John thought it was 6/19/2019, John was correct, and yesterday would have been June 18, 2019. Make sure to follow the formatting rules and adjust for any day before the month as needed.
Give me a date, specify the month and day, and ask for the date a month ago.
Calculate a date by adding one week from the input date in the first example, adding one day in the second example, and subtracting one year in the third example.
Clarify the ambiguous date format, recognize that today was March 12, 2002, and correctly calculate one year ago.
