How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
When certain actions are taken, they lead to a specific result. Ask why or how this outcome happened.
Explain causation concepts, provide examples, and encourage asking clarifying questions to ensure a thorough understanding.
Determine whether the event described in each question (e.g., employees turning on the climate control system, John's lung cancer, Alex winning because of the law, or Jake hitting the bullseye) was caused by the action mentioned (e.g., employees arriving, John's smoking, the law, or his hand slipping) or if it occurred by coincidence.
Determine the intentional nature of the described action, and output "Yes" or "No" based on the assessment.
