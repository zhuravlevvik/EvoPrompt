Determine whether the hypothesis is entailed, contradicted, or neutral with respect to the premise. Use your reasoning to explain each case.
What is the relationship between the premise and hypothesis in each input-output pair?
**Instruction:**Compare the premise and hypothesis to determine if they are in contradiction, neutral, or entailment. - If the premise supports the hypothesis, it's entailment. - If they are conflicting, it's contradiction. - If they are balanced, it's neutral.
Instruct your friend to analyze the relationship between the premise and hypothesis. Determine if they are neutral, entail, or contradict each other.
Determine the logical relation between the premise and hypothesis, and assign the output label accordingly. The output labels are "contradiction," "entailment," or "neutral."
**Instruction:** Check if the premise and hypothesis are related or contradict each other.**Output:**1. If they are contradictory, output "contradiction."2. If they entail each other (one supports the other), output "entailment."3. If they are unrelated, output "neutral."
Evaluate the relationship between the premise and hypothesis in each pair, determining if they are in contradiction, entailment, or neutral.
Analyze each premise and hypothesis for consistency. If they do not match, it is a contradiction; if they do, it is an entailment; if they are both true or both false, it is neutral.
Determine if the premise and hypothesis are consistent, contradictory, or neutral. If they are consistent but not directly related, classify them as neutral.
Evaluate the relationship between the premise and hypothesis to determine if they contradict, support, or are neutral.
Determine whether the premise entails the hypothesis. If the premise logically leads to the hypothesis, output "entailment." If not, output "neutral."
Assess whether the hypothesis is supported by the premise, leading to entailment, or not, leading to neutral.
Determine the relationship between the premise and hypothesis. The output was determined based on whether they were contradictory, neutral, or entailed.
Check for contradictions and entailments between premises and hypotheses.
