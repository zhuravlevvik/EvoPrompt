Create a table listing penguins with their attributes and determine the oldest one.
Calculate the age of each penguin and return the numerical age
List the penguins with height less than 80 cm, weight less than 12 kg, and weight less than 12 kg.
Provide a table where each line is a penguin with their age, height (cm), and weight (kg). Then, for each penguin, output their age.
List each penguin's name, age, height (cm), weight (kg) in the order provided, followed by an example of the output, then instruct your friend to add a new penguin, delete an existing one, and then sort the remaining penguins alphabetically by name.
Provide the name, age, height (cm), and weight (kg) of each penguin in the table.
Give me a table with headers and penguins, then provide the age of a specific penguin, such as Bernard. Also, ask for the cumulated age of giraffes, the last penguin sorted alphabetically, the second heaviest penguin, and the age of a specific penguin.
Begin by identifying each row in the table. For each row, check if all four columns (name, age, height in cm, weight in kg) have valid data. Count the number of valid rows or answer based on a specific value provided in the question.
List the penguins based on their height and age, and answer the questions asked about their positions, height, and age.
List each penguin's details in the order they appear in the table, one after another, with each line containing the name, age, height in cm, and weight in kg.
Process the table and determine the first penguin sorted by alphabetic order.
Identify penguins and their attributes. Query based on age, weight, and height. Delete penguins that don't meet specific criteria. Add new penguins with specific attributes. Calculate totals based on attributes. Determine the last penguin's name. Count the total number of animals in tables, including both giraffes and penguins.
