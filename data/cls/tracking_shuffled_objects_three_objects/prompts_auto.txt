I gave a friend an instruction involving a series of swaps between three people, Alice, Bob, and Claire, following a specific sequence of swaps. The user provided several input-output pairs, each illustrating the outcome after a series of swaps based on the initial gifts each person had. The instruction was to have a fixed sequence of swaps: first Alice-Bob, then Alice-Claire, then Bob-Claire, repeated until all swaps were completed. The outputs depend on the initial gifts and the sequence of swaps.
Perform a series of swaps in the order specified in each input-output pair.
To have the partners Alice and Bob swap, then Bob and Claire swap, and finally Alice and Bob swap again. This sequence of partner swaps determines who ends up with whom at the end of the event.
