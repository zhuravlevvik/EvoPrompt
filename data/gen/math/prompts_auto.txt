Let me explain the process I used to solve these problems. For each problem, I first read the instruction carefully, then identified the key steps involved. For example, for the first problem, I started by simplifying the fraction and then performed the multiplication. I also made sure to explain each step clearly to my friend so they could understand how I arrived at the solution.
"Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you solve the problem. First, read the problem statement carefully. Next, identify the key components or variables involved. Then, break down the problem into smaller, manageable parts. After that, develop a plan for solving each part. Finally, execute your plan, double-check your calculations, and verify that your solution meets all the requirements of the problem."

Here’s the step-by-step explanation of how I arrived at the answer: 1. **Understand the Problem:** - We need to find the product of two binary numbers: \(10101_2\) and \(101_2\). - The result should be expressed in binary form. 2. **Convert Binary Numbers to Decimal:** - \(10101_2\) in decimal: \[ 1 \times 2^4 + 0 \times 2^3 + 1 \times 2^2 + 0 \times 2^1 + 1 \times 2^0 = 16 + 0 + 4 + 0 + 1 = 21_{10} \] - \(101_2\) in decimal: \[ 1 \times 2^2 + 0 \times 2^1 + 1 \times 2^0 = 4 + 0 + 1 = 5_{10} \] 3. **Multiply the Decimal Values:** - \(21_{10} \times 5_{10} = 105_{10}\) 4. **Convert the Result Back to Binary:** - Divide \(105_{10}\) by 2 repeatedly: \[ 105 \div 2 = 52 \text{ with a remainder of } 1 \\ 52 \div 2 = 26 \text{ with a remainder of } 0 \\ 26 \div 2 = 13 \text{ with a remainder of } 0 \\ 13 \div 2 = 6 \text{ with a remainder of } 1 \\ 6 \div 2 = 3 \text{ with a remainder of } 0 \\ 3 \div 2 = 1 \text{ with a remainder of } 1 \\ 1 \div 2 = 0 \text{ with a remainder of } 1 \] - Reading the remainders from bottom to top: \(1101001_2\) 5. **Final Answer:** - The product of \(10101_2\) and \(101_2\) is \(1101001_2\).
Define a function \( f(n) \) as follows: \[ f(n) = \left\{ \begin{array}{cl} n + 3 & \text{if } n \text{ is odd}, \\ n/2 & \text{if } n \text{ is even}. \end{array} \right. \] Given that \( k \) is odd and \( f(f(f(k))) = 27 \), find \( k \). When \( p(x) = Ax^5 + Bx^3 + Cx + 4 \) is divided by \( x - 3 \), the remainder is 11. Find the remainder when \( p(x) \) is divided by \( x + 3 \). A line with slope 3 intersects a line with slope 5 at the point \( (10,15) \). What is the distance between the \( x \)-intercepts of these two lines?
Here's how I'm going to explain each problem step by step. For the first problem, I need to find the LCM of 12, 18, and 30. Let me think... The LCM is the smallest number that all three numbers divide into without a remainder. To find it, I can factor each number into primes: 12 is 2^2 * 3, 18 is 2 * 3^2, and 30 is 2 * 3 * 5. The LCM is the product of the highest powers of all prime factors, so that would be 2^2 * 3^2 * 5, which is 4 * 9 * 5 = 180. That's the smallest number that all three numbers divide into without a remainder. I think that's how I explained it to my friend. For the second input, I had a sequence problem where the friend needed to find the smallest possible value for the third term of a geometric progression. I probably started by setting up the equations for the arithmetic progression and then adjusted the terms as per the problem statement. I think I had to find the original three terms, then adjust them. I might have found the common difference and the terms, then calculated the geometric progression's third term. In the third problem, I was explaining how I approached polynomials with integer coefficients and roots. I started by recalling that if a polynomial has integer coefficients and integer roots, then the roots must be factors of the constant term. I might have listed all possible roots and then considered the symmetry or other properties of the polynomial to find the number of multisets. I think I made sure to mention common mistakes or pitfalls, like forgetting to take the highest powers of primes or miscalculating the roots. Putting it all together, the instruction had three parts: explaining the first problem, guiding the friend through the second, and setting up the third problem. I used a mix of examples and step-by-step explanations to make it clear. I aimed to make the process as straightforward as possible, so that my friend could follow along easily.
