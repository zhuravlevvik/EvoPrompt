Evaluate the expression as written, following the order of operations (multiplication before addition or subtraction) and respecting parentheses.
Multiply, add, subtract, and use parentheses
Evaluate the expressions by following the order of operations (multiplication first, then addition and subtraction from left to right)
Compute the expression (7 - 5 * 7 + -1) + (6 * 4 - 9 + -7).
Here are the steps to compute the results based on the input expressions: 1. **Parentheses:** Evaluate expressions inside parentheses first. 2. **Multiplication and Division:** Perform these operations from left to right. 3. **Addition and Subtraction:** Perform these operations from left to right. 4. **Order of Operations:** Follow the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) to ensure accurate results.
Perform multiplication before addition and subtraction, following the order of operations (left to right).
I gave a friend an instruction to solve a mathematical problem. The instruction involved performing a series of arithmetic operations in a specific order. The friend followed the instruction step by step to arrive at the correct output for each input. The instruction was to compute the expression by following the order of operations: first performing multiplication and division from left to right, then performing addition and subtraction from left to right. The friend handled negative numbers and multiple operations within parentheses correctly to arrive at the output values provided. Your task is to understand the instruction, follow the order of operations, and compute the results for each input to verify the outputs.
Perform addition, subtraction, and multiplication operations as shown in the examples below. Include negation where necessary.
Perform the following operations in order: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and then combine the results to get -89
Perform the following operations on the inputs:   1. First, handle addition and multiplication in the first section.   2. Then, proceed to the subtraction and mixed operations in the second section.
Perform either addition or subtraction on the two provided expressions, carefully handling negative numbers as per the operations performed.
Compute the value of the expression following the order of operations: parentheses first, then multiplication and division, and finally addition and subtraction.
